Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my website. When I'm not deep into programming, you'll find me running or playing with my Australian Cattle dogs, Jinny and Moody. Yes, they're named after Harry Potter characters!

In my free time, I'm a lead guitarist in a band called Squatchula, where we cover anything from Creedance Clearwater Revival to Kid Cudi. Early 2000's pop-punk will always have a special place in my heart.

I call the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon, my home, and I'm priveleged enough to live near the best bridge in the city, can you guess which one?
