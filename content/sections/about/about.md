Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my website. When I'm not deep into programming (and trust me, I never write bugs ðŸ˜‰), you'll find me with my Australian Cattle dogs, Jinny and Moody. Yes, they're named after Harry Potter characters!

In my free time, I'm a lead guitarist in a band called Squatchula, where we cover anything from Creedance Clearwater Revival, to Green Day, Eminem, The Strokes, and whatever we're in the mood for. Early 2000's pop-punk will always have a special place in my heart.

I call the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon, my home, and I'm priveleged enough to live near the best bridge in the city, can you guess which one?
